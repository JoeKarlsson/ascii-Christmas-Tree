##The Challenge

Write a function that prints a nice Christmas tree of any size to the DOM with it's own star at the top using the shortest code possible. The tree star is an asterisk (*), the tree body is made out of 0 The tree must be at least 10 rows high, and at the bottom of the tree should be a trunk made of 2 pipe characters (|). Every row should be properly indented in the way that the previous row are centered over the next one. Any given row must have 2 more 0s than the previous, except for the first one that is the star and the second, which has only one 0. The result is something like this:

TEST


```
          *
          0
         000
        00000
       0000000
      000000000
     00000000000
    0000000000000
   000000000000000
  00000000000000000
          ||
```

## Additional Requirements
- Create a Git Repository for this challenge
    - commit often and have your commit messages be descriptive
- Bonus points if you can do this recursivly.
- After you have finished writing your function - make it festive by styling it!
- Write tests for your function using the Mocha and Chai Libraries.
  - Provide test for all cases. Handle unexpected inputs, invalid arguments, etc.
